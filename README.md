# RegioSQM
See (insert DOI here) for more details

RegioSQM consists of two bash scripts, `RegioSQM1` and `RegioSQM2`, and an Jupyter Notebook analysis tool `RegioSQM_highlight_atom.ipynb`. RegioSQM1 and RegioSQM2 call other python scripts and bash scripts and calls OpenBabel. Some of the python scripts use RDKit. The method makes use of the semiempirical quantum chemistry program MOPAC. 

The very first time you use the scripts type `chmod +x RegioSQM1 RegioSQM2`

Try example:

    ./RegioSQM1 example pm3_mop

"example" refers to the text file `example.smiles` and "pm3_mop" refer to the text file `pm3_mop.header`. 
RegioSQM creates a folder called example_pm3_mop with the mopac input files and submits to a slurm queue using the bash script `submit_bactches_mopac`.

Once all calculations finish:

    ./RegioSQM2 example_pm3_mop

This creates example_pm3_mop_1.pka and example_pm3_mop_3.pka which contains the atom number(s) of the most nucleophilic unsubstituted aromatic carbon(s) and the name of the mopac output file for the corresponding isomer using a 1 and 3 kcal/mol cutoff.  

highlight_atoms.py creates svg files with pictures of the molecules where atom centers listed in the .pka file are highlighted. These two svg files are then merged into a single file using merge_svg.py, which also changes the colors of the highlighted atoms.  Note that highlight_atoms.py reguires the installation of ipython.  

The resulting svg file (marked combined) can be opened in a browser or converted to pdf by third party software.
